## Prerequisites

To use the Tradenity SDK, you must have:

-  Working Ruby development environment (currently v1.9.3 and v2.2.x are supported).
-  Active account in [Tradenity](http://www.tradenity.com)


## Installation

You can install the Ruby SDK using the standard `gem` tool.

`gem install tradenity`


## Setup your credentials

First of all, you have to get API keys for your store, you can find it in your store `Edit` page.
To get there navigate to the stores list page, click on the `Edit` button next to your store name, scroll down till you find the `API Keys` section.


## Initialize the library

With the API key in hand, you can initialize the Tradenity client.
Tradenity client needs the API key and an instance of AuthTokenHolder
which is an object that makes Tradenity session integrates with the web framework's session mechanism.
The SDK provide implementation for Flask and Django. It's easy to implement your own for other frameworks, It is a simple 3 method interface.



```ruby

require 'Tradenity'

Tradenity.api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx'

```
Make sure to replace the api keys with the ones for your store, otherwise you will get authentication error

## Make your First call

The Tradenity SDK is organized into a group of model entitiy classes that corresponds to the REST API's resources, each encapsulate the operation for a specific entity model,
for example to perform operations related to the `Brand` resource you can use the corresponding `tradenity.sdk.entities.Brand` class.



Now, just call any method in your code.

```ruby

@brand = Brand.find_by_id("1243-9786786-jhgjtu-789s6i")

```
